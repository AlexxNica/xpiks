Xpiks has one feature which was never announced publicly: support for plugins. This makes it exceptionally versatile tool for all kind of organizations which can customize this application for their needs.

This post is about a <a href="https://maground.com/">photo studio</a> which got hands on Xpiks with special plugin for them which allowed to speedup their workflow.

This plugin operates on currently active artwork and fills in specific presets create by the studio. It's being registered on the side bar and therefore available in all editing modes.
