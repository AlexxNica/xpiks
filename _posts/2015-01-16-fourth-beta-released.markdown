I'm proud to announce fourth release of Cross-platform image keywording software v1.0-beta4! Few important improvements and fixes of old issues. You can find binaries at Downloads page.

This beta release is the biggest of current beta releases because of useful and major features it provides:

- Added workfiles, which backup entered but not saved keywords and other metadata
- Added ability to Drag&Drop images to workflow
- FTP credentials checking on upload (notifies if something is missing e.g. username, password)
- Checks for potential problems on upload (insufficient resolution, missing metadata, too much keywords etc)
