This serie of posts will describe typical use case of Xpiks. Xpiks was created for microstockers by microstocker. It should help you to minimize time you spend keywording and uploading images or illustrations to stock agencies.

You will learn how:

- add images to flow
- keyword images
- save XMP/IPTC metadata
- upload images to selected microstocks

In this post you will learn how to add images for keywording or upload and to add keywords and other metadata to existing images.

First of all, open Xpiks. You'll see main window with no added images:

<img alt="Main window" src="{{site.url}}/images/howto/xpiks-qt-justopened.jpg" class="small-12 large-8 columns page-content" />

Then you can add files via "Add files" or "Add directory" button. Both can add only JPG files. Let's add some files. When you select files or directories and open them an import dialog launches. It helps to import existing IPTC metadata into Xpiks.

Press "Start import" to actually start importing metadata or just "Close" to skip this step.

In current version of Xpiks you won't be able to import metadata later. If import finishes with success, progress bar will remain blue and in case of errors it becomes red.

Now you can proceed to editing metadata.

<img alt="Import finished" src="{{site.url}}/images/howto/xpiks-qt-imported.jpg" class="small-12 large-8 columns page-content" />

If you have images which would have many similar keywords, you can process them using combined edit. To do that, just select similar images and press "Edit" button in top right control box.

The following popup will appear:
