This serie of posts will describe typical use case of Xpiks.

You will learn how:
* add images to flow
* keyword images
* save XMP/IPTC metadata
* upload images to selected microstocks

In this post you will learn how to add images for keywording or upload.

First of all, open Xpiks. You'll see main window with no added images:

![Main window]({{site.url}}/images/howto/xpiks-qt-justopened.jpg)

Then you can add files via "Add files" or "Add directory" button. Both can add only JPG files. Let's add some files. When you select files or directories and open them an import dialog launches. It helps to import existing IPTC metadata into Xpiks.
