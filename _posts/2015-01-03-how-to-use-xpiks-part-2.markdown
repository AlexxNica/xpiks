This serie of posts will describe typical use case of Xpiks. Xpiks was created for microstockers by microstocker. It should help you to minimize time you spend keywording and uploading images or illustrations to stock agencies.

You will learn how:

- add artworks to flow
- keyword artworks
- save XMP/IPTC metadata
- upload artworks to microstocks

In this post you will learn how to save edited artworks and to upload them to microstocks.

As you can recall from <a href="{{site.url}}/blog/2015/how-to-use-xpiks-part-1">previous post</a>, we added and keyworded a bunch of images. It's time to upload images and earn some money. If you'll try to select all of them and press "Upload" button, you'll gen a warning, that there're unsaved images in items you're going to upload.

So let's save them. In order to do that, just select images you want to save and press "Save" button. An export dialog will pop up. You have an option to save a backup for each artworks (keyword are being written to same file you've opened).
