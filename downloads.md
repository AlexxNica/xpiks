Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/Ribtoks/xpiks/releases/tag/v1.0-beta.1">download section</a> at Github page of Xpiks release.

<p>
Package for Windows has ExifTool and Curl supplied inside, while package for OS X doesn't so you have to download it manually in order to use Xpiks. You can <a href="http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/%7Ephil/exiftool/">download ExifTool here</a> and curl is already available in your OS X.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to build Xpiks for your own platform, please, refer to <a href="{{site.url}}/blog/2014/building-xpiks-alone">this post</a>.
