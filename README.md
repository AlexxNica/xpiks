Cross-platform (X) Photo Keywording Software

Xpiks is a free and open source keywording and uploading tool for microstock photographers and illustrators with no hidden fees. If you're tired with copy and pasting keywords from one stock to another, Xpiks would be a great time saver for you!

**Main features:**

- ability to keyword images as well as set additional XMP/IPTC metadata (title, description, author)
- uploading images to Stock Agencies' FTP hosts (saves credentials for each host)
- ability to upload vector eps files with images with same name (useful for illustrators)
- checks for potential problems before upload (insufficient resolution, missing metadata etc.)
- unsaved work is backed up so you can continue work later without actual writing metadata to images
- Ability to Drag'n'Drop images to workflow
- works under Linux, OS X and Windows
- ExifTool and Curl under the hood
- written in C++ with Qt 5.4
