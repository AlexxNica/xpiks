Xpiks is a free and open source keywording and uploading tool for microstock photographers and illustrators. It was written from scratch with aim to make it more usefull, convenient and quicker than existing tools.

**Main features:**

- adding/editing XMP/IPTC metadata (title, description, keywords)
- uploading images to Stock Agencies' FTP hosts (saves encrypted credentials for each host)
- keywords suggestion based on Shutterstock API, iStock, Fotolia or the local library
- search through loaded images by any metadata (keywords, description, title)
- ability to upload vector files with images (with automatic zipping if needed)
- checks for potential problems before upload (insufficient resolution, missing metadata etc.)
- automatically checks spelling of description, title and keywords
- autocompletion for keywords (English dictionary)
- unsaved work is backed up so you can continue work later without actual writing metadata to images
- localized to other languages (Ukrainian, Portugese, Spanish, Catalan, Russian, French, German) 
- works under Linux, OS X and Windows
- written in C++ with Qt 5.5
