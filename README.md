Official website: http://ribtoks.github.io/xpiks/

Xpiks is a free and open source keywording and uploading tool for microstock photographers and illustrators. It was written from scratch with aim to make it more usefull, convenient and quicker than existing tools.

**Main features:**

- ability to keyword images as well as set additional XMP/IPTC metadata (title, description, author)
- uploading images to Stock Agencies' FTP hosts (saves credentials for each host)
- keywords suggestion based on Shutterstock API
- search through loaded images by any metadata (keywords, description, title)
- ability to upload vector files with images with same name (useful for illustrators)
- automatically zip vector files with previews (useful for illustrators)
- checks for potential problems before upload (insufficient resolution, missing metadata etc.)
- unsaved work is backed up so you can continue work later without actual writing metadata to images
- works under Linux, OS X and Windows
- ExifTool and Curl under the hood
- written in C++ with Qt 5.4
