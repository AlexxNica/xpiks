Project guidelines:

- Before you push your commits ensure that project builds without errors and warnings and all tests are passing

Coding guidelines:

- always put a class into a namespace
- class fields variables should be private except special cases when they can be protected
- class fields should be named using the `m_CamelCase` style (starting with "m_" and then the name starting with the capital letter)
- try to move as much includes from the header to implementation as possible
